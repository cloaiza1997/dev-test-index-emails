Three are Navajo and\none is Santa Domingo.  The Santa Domingo is the necklace that keeps the\nsame shape throughout the whole piece.  The most expensive necklace is\ngoing to be an older piece, and it is a nice piece which uses turquoise\nbetween beads instead of heishe.\nprice 005s.jpg $425 (ahy 443)\nprice 006s.jpg $325 (ajj 323)\nprice 007s.jpg $750 (ahp 119)\nprice 008s.jpg $175 (ahg 595)\n\nPlease let me know if this is not what you had in mind.

In order to \nmake the best use of our limited time at the meeting I am attaching a copy of \nthe "draft" material which will appear on the Intranet Site regarding P&D \n(Participation & Dissent).   The intent is for you to review the material \nbefore the session to gain some insight into what P&D is all about.  This \nwill save us the time of having to review this material at the session and \nallow us to focus specifically on facilitation skills for the P&D process.  \nWe apologize for the somewhat disjointed format.  At the moment it is the \nonly complete draft that is available, albeit in pieces.  I suggest you start \nwith the last one listed below P&D Site maps.ppt and then progress through \nthem in order 1,2,3,4,5.\n\n\n\nP&D  was develop as a response to three of the 5 core ETC (Now known as the \nPulse) questions identified by Enron for improvement. They are: \n\n  Most employees feel free to voice their opinions openly \n  My operating company does a good job acting on suggestions of employees\n  Employees are encourage to challenge established \nprocedures/policies/guidelines\n\nParticipation & Dissent know as "P&D" is an unique Enron created tool that is \ndesigned to provide our employees with a creative, free wheeling, \nnon-bureaucratic vehicle for solving problems, addressing issues, enhancing \ndecision making and developing new business ideas/opportunities.   One \npurpose of "P&D" is to create an atmosphere where employees can feel real \nownership for decisions and express their views in a challenging and \npassionate way. "P&D" sessions are meant to focus on results and assist in \nproducing measurable performance improvements.  "P&D" sessions are to assist \nour employees in driving change in an organized, efficient and effective \nmanner.  It will help us leverage off our own best practices to produce \nfaster results that positively impact our return on invested capital. At \nEnron we give our employees the power to dissent and with that power comes \nthe obligation to participate in providing solutions/ideas. \n\nIf you have any questions about this material, please feel free to contact \nKirk McDaniel or myself.  We will be happy to answer your questions and \nprovide additional context for the effort.\n\nThe only other thing we would like you to do prior to attending the session \nis to identify a potential P&D intervention within your own organization.  \nThis will provide you with a "real" effort to begin planning for at the \nsession and make the application of the ideas directly actionable for you.\n\nWe look forward to seeing you at the meeting.\n            Dick Amabile',

If there is anything in it that disadvantages \nus, we should consider rehearing, particularly since it is a nearly certain \nthat our friends at SoCal will file a nasty one. (It might be good for Steve \nH. or Bill or whoever has the best relationship with SoCal to make a high \nlevel courtesy call to extend the olive branch and tell them that we'll work \nwith them to minimize their concerns blah blah blah.  At minimum, we'll \nprobably learn if they do intend to seek rehearing)  \n\nI see two things that may be worth seeking rehearing on:\n\n1.  The requirement that we disclose our discount agreements in 15 days.  \nFERC really punted this issue.  They say that \"since the expansion capacity \nis fully subscribed we see no reason why Transwestern should not publicly \ndisclose the agreements. . . . \"  This is the first time I've heard of any \nrule that if your project is fully subscribed you therefore lose your right \nto confidential treatment of sensitive pricing info.  At minimum, we could \nargue that the requirement is arbitrary and capricious because FERC didn't \neven mention its normal regulations and procedures governing filing of \ndiscount reports.  It just cited the certificate regulation that requires an \napplicant to \"file\" its rate information with the Commission (which we did) \nand ignores the regulation (Sec. 284.7(c)(6)) that doesn't require a pipeline \nto publicly disclose its discounts until 15 days  after the close of the \nbilling period to which the discount pertained.  The commercial people need \nto decide if we care about this issue--i.e., how upset will the customers \nwith the high rates be when they learn about the low rates?    Also, Frank \nand Steve and Susan--since the order imposes a 15 day deadline on this issue, \ndo we need to file for a stay first and then rehearing? \n\n2.  The ECS issue.  \nI think we can work around this for the Gallup project, by filing a report \ndescribing the operational control TW has under the O & M agreement.   I've \ntalked to Mark Knippa of ECS and he is running the idea by Courtney and will \nget back to me today.  My real worry is what the \"operational control\" \nrequirement does to our future outsourcing/ monetization projects.  I think \nECS and Hanover need to have operational control over the assets in our other \ndeals (i.e., TW compressor monetization) in order for both of us to get the \naccounting treatment we need to monetize the forward revenue streams.  If we \nagree that TW will keep absolute operational control on this deal, FERC will \nuse it as precedent when we come in with the TW compression deal.  Arthur \nAnderson will crap on the monetization part of that deal (which is, after \nall, the whole point of doing it) if TW retains too much control over the \nasset.  I'm not sure how to solve this yet, but lets all put some thought \ninto it.  \n\n3.  Any others???\n\nI'll turf to MKM the question of whether we need to set up a meeting on this \nand when to chat.  DF",

Wording lifted from offer letter. 100% agreed.\n\nWhile we have agreed to above, please bear in mind:\n\n- Contracts will now be delayed until wording is finally signed off by lawyers (eta 3 hours)\n- We have to draw the line on further changes en mass now or we won\'t get anything done.\n- We have not "agreed" salary and promotions completely. UBS are concerned about percentages of a few. I think we will have resolution this evening.\n- I am not expecting new docs until late this evening.\n\nDavid',

We have basically offered them a\nfinancial product that works as described below:\nAttached is a one page description of the structure.\n\n(See attached file: Structure.ppt)\n\nTerms and Conditions of the agreement:\nVolume: 20MW x 7 days a week x 24 hours a day\nTerm: 3 years, 1999\nStart Date: August 1st.\nIndex: Simple hourly average Monomic at Ezeiza\nStructure: "Collar" (Enron sells and EDEN buys):\n- Cap: @$20.15/MWh\n- 1st year, floor: @$18.14/MWh\n- 2nd year, floor: @18.05/MWh\n- 3rd year, floor: @17.96/MWh\nZero-cost call option (Cap) for Enron:  @$22.16/Mwh.  (Enron buys and EDEN \nsells).\n\nExample:\nWhen Index is between $22.16 and $20.15, Enron pays to Eden. If Index is \nabove $22.16, Enron keeps on paying $2.01 (Difference between $22.16 and \n$20.15).\nWhen Index is between $20.15 and the floor (different every year), no \npayments are involved.\nWhen Index is below the floor price, Eden pays to Enron whatever Index minus \nFloor is.\n\nPending issues:\nCredit approval\nMaster Swap Agreement in place\nFinalise negotiations. There is a high probability of this deal happening. \nTiming for closing is close to 10 days.\n\nIf you have any questions, let  me know.\n\nRolo\n\n\n\n\n\nTo:   Rodolfo Freyre/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT\ncc:\n\nSubject:  Empresa Distribuidora de Energi Norte\n\nRodolfo-\n\nI received your fax of the financial statements.\n\nWill you please advise on the details of this deal.\n\nThank you,\n\nPat Cini\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n - pic11719.pcx - Structure.ppt',

For the time being, we are going to \nwork with them on another deal (which I will explain below) and we will \nsuspend the Swap deal that we were currently working on..\n\nEden - Siderca - Enron Deal\n\nEden has a full-requirement PPA (140MW) with a TOP of around 50 MWs with \nSiderca that ends on May 31st, 2006. The contract price is approximately $30 \n/Mwh (adjusted with a formula) clearly out of the money.   The contract also \nstates that Siderca will have to pay $12MM penalty to Eden in the event \nSiderca wants to early terminate the contract. We have proposed to Eden the \nfollowing structure:\n\nEnron will pay Eden an upfront payment of $12MM so that Eden terminates the \ncontract with Siderca, and then Enron can transact with Siderca. Enron will \nsign a MSA with Siderca selling (financially) for around 70 MW flat during \nthe term of the agreement.\nEnron will sign a MSA with a Generator (possibly CTSN - an AES Co. - or \nCentral Puerto) to buy (financially) 70 MW flat during the term of the \nagreement.\nSiderca will sign a physical power contract with a generator for 70 MW @ spot \nprices.\nTerm of the agreement: Nov \'99 - March \'06.\n\nOne important point is to determine what will the concept for the Upfront \nPayment that Enron will make to Eden. Fede and I\nthought about two options:\nDummy Option or,\nDirect Payment to the Main Shareholders of Eden on an off-shore basis\n\nI am attaching a slide were the transaction is described. If you have any \nquestions about the deal structure, do not hesitate to call either Fede or \nmyself.\n\nRolo\n\n(See attached file: Siderca-Eden.ppt)\n - Siderca-Eden.ppt',

I \nwill advise when I have heard back from Argentina on their further \ndiscussions with the counterparty regarding the ISDA.\n\nLet's discuss if any questions.\n\n\n\nRegards,\n\nPat\n\n---------------------- Forwarded by Patricia Cini/HOU/ECT on 10/20/99 04:47 \nPM ---------------------------\n   \n\tEnron North America Corp.\n\t\n\tFrom:  Patricia Cini                           10/19/99 06:12 PM\n\t\n\nTo: Rodolfo Freyre@Enron\ncc: Jeff Kabel@Enron, Federico Cerisoli@Enron, William S \nBradford/HOU/ECT@ECT, Sara Shackleton/HOU/ECT@ECT \nSubject: TGS ISDA\n\nRolo-\n\nWe can agree to sign the Master ISDA without the CSA.

In order to \nmake the best use of our limited time at the meeting I am attaching a copy of \nthe "draft" material which will appear on the Intranet Site regarding P&D \n(Participation & Dissent).   The intent is for you to review the material \nbefore the session to gain some insight into what P&D is all about.  This \nwill save us the time of having to review this material at the session and \nallow us to focus specifically on facilitation skills for the P&D process.  \nWe apologize for the somewhat disjointed format.  At the moment it is the \nonly complete draft that is available, albeit in pieces.  I suggest you start \nwith the last one listed below P&D Site maps.ppt and then progress through \nthem in order 1,2,3,4,5.\n\n\n\nP&D  was develop as a response to three of the 5 core ETC (Now known as the \nPulse) questions identified by Enron for improvement. They are: \n\n  Most employees feel free to voice their opinions openly \n  My operating company does a good job acting on suggestions of employees\n  Employees are encourage to challenge established \nprocedures/policies/guidelines\n\nParticipation & Dissent know as "P&D" is an unique Enron created tool that is \ndesigned to provide our employees with a creative, free wheeling, \nnon-bureaucratic vehicle for solving problems, addressing issues, enhancing \ndecision making and developing new business ideas/opportunities.   One \npurpose of "P&D" is to create an atmosphere where employees can feel real \nownership for decisions and express their views in a challenging and \npassionate way. "P&D" sessions are meant to focus on results and assist in \nproducing measurable performance improvements.  "P&D" sessions are to assist \nour employees in driving change in an organized, efficient and effective \nmanner.  It will help us leverage off our own best practices to produce \nfaster results that positively impact our return on invested capital. At \nEnron we give our employees the power to dissent and with that power comes \nthe obligation to participate in providing solutions/ideas. \n\nIf you have any questions about this material, please feel free to contact \nKirk McDaniel or myself.  We will be happy to answer your questions and \nprovide additional context for the effort.\n\nThe only other thing we would like you to do prior to attending the session \nis to identify a potential P&D intervention within your own organization.  \nThis will provide you with a "real" effort to begin planning for at the \nsession and make the application of the ideas directly actionable for you.\n\nWe look forward to seeing you at the meeting.\n            Dick Amabile',

If there is anything in it that disadvantages \nus, we should consider rehearing, particularly since it is a nearly certain \nthat our friends at SoCal will file a nasty one. (It might be good for Steve \nH. or Bill or whoever has the best relationship with SoCal to make a high \nlevel courtesy call to extend the olive branch and tell them that we'll work \nwith them to minimize their concerns blah blah blah.  At minimum, we'll \nprobably learn if they do intend to seek rehearing)  \n\nI see two things that may be worth seeking rehearing on:\n\n1.  The requirement that we disclose our discount agreements in 15 days.  \nFERC really punted this issue.  They say that \"since the expansion capacity \nis fully subscribed we see no reason why Transwestern should not publicly \ndisclose the agreements. . . . \"  This is the first time I've heard of any \nrule that if your project is fully subscribed you therefore lose your right \nto confidential treatment of sensitive pricing info.  At minimum, we could \nargue that the requirement is arbitrary and capricious because FERC didn't \neven mention its normal regulations and procedures governing filing of \ndiscount reports.  It just cited the certificate regulation that requires an \napplicant to \"file\" its rate information with the Commission (which we did) \nand ignores the regulation (Sec. 284.7(c)(6)) that doesn't require a pipeline \nto publicly disclose its discounts until 15 days  after the close of the \nbilling period to which the discount pertained.  The commercial people need \nto decide if we care about this issue--i.e., how upset will the customers \nwith the high rates be when they learn about the low rates?    Also, Frank \nand Steve and Susan--since the order imposes a 15 day deadline on this issue, \ndo we need to file for a stay first and then rehearing? \n\n2.  The ECS issue.  \nI think we can work around this for the Gallup project, by filing a report \ndescribing the operational control TW has under the O & M agreement.   I've \ntalked to Mark Knippa of ECS and he is running the idea by Courtney and will \nget back to me today.  My real worry is what the \"operational control\" \nrequirement does to our future outsourcing/ monetization projects.  I think \nECS and Hanover need to have operational control over the assets in our other \ndeals (i.e., TW compressor monetization) in order for both of us to get the \naccounting treatment we need to monetize the forward revenue streams.  If we \nagree that TW will keep absolute operational control on this deal, FERC will \nuse it as precedent when we come in with the TW compression deal.  Arthur \nAnderson will crap on the monetization part of that deal (which is, after \nall, the whole point of doing it) if TW retains too much control over the \nasset.  I'm not sure how to solve this yet, but lets all put some thought \ninto it.  \n\n3.  Any others???\n\nI'll turf to MKM the question of whether we need to set up a meeting on this \nand when to chat.  DF",

Wording 95% agreed.\n\n3 - Non-compete to exclude Enron retrospective reference\nRe-wording of this clause to focus on NETCo and ENA rather than Enron. Wording 50% agreed.\n\n4 - Miscellaneous clause\nChange to clause that says ee reps they know of no claims, grievances, to be changed to "against individual". 100% agreed.\n\n5 - Recognition of prior Enron service wording\nAdded to contracts. Wording lifted from offer letter. 100% agreed.\n\nWhile we have agreed to above, please bear in mind:\n\n- Contracts will now be delayed until wording is finally signed off by lawyers (eta 3 hours)\n- We have to draw the line on further changes en mass now or we won\'t get anything done.\n- We have not "agreed" salary and promotions completely. UBS are concerned about percentages of a few. I think we will have resolution this evening.\n- I am not expecting new docs until late this evening.\n\nDavid',

We have basically offered them a\nfinancial product that works as described below:\nAttached is a one page description of the structure.\n\n(See attached file: Structure.ppt)\n\nTerms and Conditions of the agreement:\nVolume: 20MW x 7 days a week x 24 hours a day\nTerm: 3 years, 1999\nStart Date: August 1st.\nIndex: Simple hourly average Monomic at Ezeiza\nStructure: "Collar" (Enron sells and EDEN buys):\n- Cap: @$20.15/MWh\n- 1st year, floor: @$18.14/MWh\n- 2nd year, floor: @18.05/MWh\n- 3rd year, floor: @17.96/MWh\nZero-cost call option (Cap) for Enron:  @$22.16/Mwh.  (Enron buys and EDEN \nsells).\n\nExample:\nWhen Index is between $22.16 and $20.15, Enron pays to Eden. If Index is \nabove $22.16, Enron keeps on paying $2.01 (Difference between $22.16 and \n$20.15).\nWhen Index is between $20.15 and the floor (different every year), no \npayments are involved.\nWhen Index is below the floor price, Eden pays to Enron whatever Index minus \nFloor is.\n\nPending issues:\nCredit approval\nMaster Swap Agreement in place\nFinalise negotiations. There is a high probability of this deal happening. \nTiming for closing is close to 10 days.\n\nIf you have any questions, let  me know.\n\nRolo\n\n\n\n\n\nTo:   Rodolfo Freyre/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT\ncc:\n\nSubject:  Empresa Distribuidora de Energi Norte\n\nRodolfo-\n\nI received your fax of the financial statements.\n\nWill you please advise on the details of this deal.\n\nThank you,\n\nPat Cini\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n - pic11719.pcx - Structure.ppt',

For the time being, we are going to \nwork with them on another deal (which I will explain below) and we will \nsuspend the Swap deal that we were currently working on..\n\nEden - Siderca - Enron Deal\n\nEden has a full-requirement PPA (140MW) with a TOP of around 50 MWs with \nSiderca that ends on May 31st, 2006. The contract price is approximately $30 \n/Mwh (adjusted with a formula) clearly out of the money.   The contract also \nstates that Siderca will have to pay $12MM penalty to Eden in the event \nSiderca wants to early terminate the contract. We have proposed to Eden the \nfollowing structure:\n\nEnron will pay Eden an upfront payment of $12MM so that Eden terminates the \ncontract with Siderca, and then Enron can transact with Siderca. Enron will \nsign a MSA with Siderca selling (financially) for around 70 MW flat during \nthe term of the agreement.\nEnron will sign a MSA with a Generator (possibly CTSN - an AES Co. - or \nCentral Puerto) to buy (financially) 70 MW flat during the term of the \nagreement.\nSiderca will sign a physical power contract with a generator for 70 MW @ spot \nprices.\nTerm of the agreement: Nov \'99 - March \'06.\n\nOne important point is to determine what will the concept for the Upfront \nPayment that Enron will make to Eden. Fede and I\nthought about two options:\nDummy Option or,\nDirect Payment to the Main Shareholders of Eden on an off-shore basis\n\nI am attaching a slide were the transaction is described. If you have any \nquestions about the deal structure, do not hesitate to call either Fede or \nmyself.\n\nRolo\n\n(See attached file: Siderca-Eden.ppt)\n - Siderca-Eden.ppt',

If there is anything in it that disadvantages \nus, we should consider rehearing, particularly since it is a nearly certain \nthat our friends at SoCal will file a nasty one. (It might be good for Steve \nH. or Bill or whoever has the best relationship with SoCal to make a high \nlevel courtesy call to extend the olive branch and tell them that we'll work \nwith them to minimize their concerns blah blah blah.  At minimum, we'll \nprobably learn if they do intend to seek rehearing)  \n\nI see two things that may be worth seeking rehearing on:\n\n1.  The requirement that we disclose our discount agreements in 15 days.  \nFERC really punted this issue.  They say that \"since the expansion capacity \nis fully subscribed we see no reason why Transwestern should not publicly \ndisclose the agreements. . . . \"  This is the first time I've heard of any \nrule that if your project is fully subscribed you therefore lose your right \nto confidential treatment of sensitive pricing info.  At minimum, we could \nargue that the requirement is arbitrary and capricious because FERC didn't \neven mention its normal regulations and procedures governing filing of \ndiscount reports.  It just cited the certificate regulation that requires an \napplicant to \"file\" its rate information with the Commission (which we did) \nand ignores the regulation (Sec. 284.7(c)(6)) that doesn't require a pipeline \nto publicly disclose its discounts until 15 days  after the close of the \nbilling period to which the discount pertained.  The commercial people need \nto decide if we care about this issue--i.e., how upset will the customers \nwith the high rates be when they learn about the low rates?    Also, Frank \nand Steve and Susan--since the order imposes a 15 day deadline on this issue, \ndo we need to file for a stay first and then rehearing? \n\n2.  The ECS issue.  \nI think we can work around this for the Gallup project, by filing a report \ndescribing the operational control TW has under the O & M agreement.   I've \ntalked to Mark Knippa of ECS and he is running the idea by Courtney and will \nget back to me today.  My real worry is what the \"operational control\" \nrequirement does to our future outsourcing/ monetization projects.  I think \nECS and Hanover need to have operational control over the assets in our other \ndeals (i.e., TW compressor monetization) in order for both of us to get the \naccounting treatment we need to monetize the forward revenue streams.  If we \nagree that TW will keep absolute operational control on this deal, FERC will \nuse it as precedent when we come in with the TW compression deal.  Arthur \nAnderson will crap on the monetization part of that deal (which is, after \nall, the whole point of doing it) if TW retains too much control over the \nasset.  I'm not sure how to solve this yet, but lets all put some thought \ninto it.  \n\n3.  Any others???\n\nI'll turf to MKM the question of whether we need to set up a meeting on this \nand when to chat.  DF",
